# Domain-Centric-Chatbot

## Langchain, OpenAI, and Vector DB from faiss

This chatbot is designed to be fine-tuned for specific domains with the latest information, eliminating the need to pay additional fees for Langchain agents.

## Project Overview

- **ChatBot Architecture**: The project leverages Langchain and OpenAI to build an adaptable chatbot that can be fine-tuned for specific domains, ensuring the latest information is always at your fingertips.

- **Data Retrieval**: The chatbot is equipped with the capability to fetch the latest information from websites. **Note:** Websites need to be bot-friendly
- **Development Status**: The working model is ready and operational in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Pending Tasks

Here are the pending tasks for the project:

- [ ] **Deployment**: The next step is to deploy the chatbot and create a user-friendly interface for interaction. Streamlit is planned for this purpose, enabling seamless interactions with the chatbot.

- [ ] **Vector Store Integration**: To enhance efficiency on local machines, I am working on integrating a Vector DB from Faiss for document similarity search through pinecone


## Collaboration

 Feel free to contribute, share ideas, and let's take this chatbot to the next level.
